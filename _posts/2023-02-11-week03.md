This week we learned about Git and Version Control and started to practice using it through GitHub. Since we had already downloaded Mozilla Firefox, we were able to experiment with some extensions. I had never implemented an extension onto my browser like that before so I though it was an interesting activity and a cool way to get us into the group project. 

I started looking into different possibilities for fairly simple browser extensions like the ones implemented in class which had more of an aesthetic impact to the browser, or more of a fun use rather than a clear purpose. Although these extensions were cool, I am more interestied in the practical ones like a notepad or an adblocker extension.

The only major issue I ahve been running inot with Git is properly setting up the remote repository so that my local repo can be properly synced up. I think once I get this issue fixed and with a little more practice I'll have a better handle on Git which wil be usedul for future projects. Since this is our first project, this has been more of a learning experience for me.
