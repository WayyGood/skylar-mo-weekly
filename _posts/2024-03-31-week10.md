title: Week 10
---

After coming back from spring break, my group was a little bit behind on making ocntirbutions because of our last minute project switch. No that we had selected a user friendly project that we could all contribute to, we focused on going through the project to find issues to contribute to. We also spent time going over some of the existing code to understand the project more.

We found an issue regarding code coverage that had been labeled good for first time contributors. On the issue, there were multiple different parts of the code that need mroe unit testing so my team members and I each commmented on one to get the approval to work on it. Luckily they responded pretty early on so we started looking on whjat kinds of changes needed to be made in order to improve the overall code coverage.

Teammates had linked a site that had percentages of code coverage and highlighted the fragments of code that already had tests written for them. This made it easier to target what parts of the code to focus on, and as a group we started working on making changes that would lead to a Pull Request.

Overall, this week was fairly productive as we were able to communicate with contributors that work for Teammates, and we were able to get assigned areas to work on. Next week I hope to finish up my code so that I can make a Pull Request and get it reviewed.
