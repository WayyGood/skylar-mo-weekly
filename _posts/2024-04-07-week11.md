title: Week 11
---

This past week was one of the more productive weeks working on the open source project this semester. With my team I was able to work on an issue and comment on it to get the okay to make a Pull request. The issue was labeled for first time contributors and the content was improving the code coverage on specified parts of the code. I did some research to learn more about unit testing, and the specific piece of code I was working on, and added some tests. I ended up making a Pull Request that is waiting to be checked out and approved.

Last week I had tried to make an issue that would allow me and my team members to translate the README, Code of Conduct, and other files into different languages. We thought this would be a good idea since this project is worked on by people in several different parts of the world. This week we heard back from the team that they already have some parts of the contributor guide, and the rest of it is changing so often that they want to keep it in English so that there aren't discrepancies. We are now looking for more ways to contribute to the project once we finish with the current issue.

Overall, it has been a successful week, and I am looking forward toheairng back from Teammates so that I can continue contributing to the project.
