title: Week 12

This week Christopher Snider gave our class a presentation on Tidepool, and spoke on how the company is open source. It was really interesting to be able to hear his personal experience working with TidePool and how it has impacted his life. I think one of the most impressive parts of open source development is that it can be used to reach so many different groups of people. Christopher spoke about Diabetes devices, and how Tidepool is able to develop technology that helps people monitor their health easily and efficiently. He shared his own personal story with Diabetes, and how working on this project is so important to him as he is able to use the products and make an impact on his community. Hearing his insight helped me see how open source projects can be created for a variety of reasons, and make an actual impact.

Other than getting to hear Christopher Snider speak, this week my group worked more on our project and I kind of hit a road block. My Pull Request was reviewed and I was asked to make a few changes. Since I don't want to make adjustments without knowing that I am doing it correctly, I am a little more hesitant to change my code. I've done some more research independently, and plan on asking my teammates for some advice on how they addressed the comments on their Pull Requests (if they had any). Overall, I think I will be able to fix my PR and resubmit this week, and start working on more items.
