title: Week 8

This week, we decide on a project: Zulip. Zulip is an open source project that aims on helping with team collaboration and communication. We had gone through so many projects and had difficulty finding one that we would be able to contribute to. Zulip had checked off all the boxes and seemed to have soe issues that were good for first time contributors. Each of us worked on downloading and setting up the development environment to make sure everything was working well. 

Unfortunately, when installing the development environment, we realized that it was a bit more complicated to contribute to the project than we had hoped and decided that we needed to continue looking for a project. We had found a site that compiled a bunch of open source projects that were good for first time contributors. By going through that site and similar sites, we came across TEAMMATES which is an open source project that helps teachers manage peer evaluations and feedback for their students. The project is very first time user friendly. When setting up the development environment, all of my team members were successful so we decided to switch to this project. When I come back from spring break I plan on finding an issue and make a Pull Request.
